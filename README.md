  3. Font Size
UI is having three button **Clear**,**Save and Download**, **Retreive save Signature**,
By using clear buttons we can **Clear** Canvas on one click. using **Save and Download** we can save and download it in **.jpeg** format and using **Retreive save Signature** button we can undo a saved signature that we clear recently.
